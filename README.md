### challenges faced :-
React is an engaging and highly efficient library for building user interfaces. It took a while to learn how to navigate to another page, but eventually, I discovered it can be accomplished using the navigate('/') command. Knowing libraries like MUI and Chakra was also valuable, Additionally, I created a relatively simple design in Figma  ,
